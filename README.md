There are two javascript files in this repository, they are app.js and bonus.js.  Please compile app.js file first followed by bonus.js.  
Note that the gauge chart shows the wash frequency as a number when an ID is selected from the drop down menu.  The grey bar moves in the gauge chart to show the frequency of wash.  
I chose 2 washes per week as a threshold minimum which is indicated by a red line in the gauge chart.
